# E-can Raspberry PI

This repo was developed during my Graduate Reasearch Assistantship (GRA).
It includes code to be deployed on a Raspberry PI.

The objective is to control a stepper motor to take 360 degrees pictures of garbage.
Then, upload the images to a [Django web application](https://github.com/jsmedmar/ecan_app).

# Important

Please note that this was one of my first-ever experiences with python. As such, code reflects almost 0 years of experience.
