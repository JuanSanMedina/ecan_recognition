# E-can Raspberry PI

This repo was developed during my Graduate Reasearch Assistantship (GRA). 

It includes code to be deployed on a Raspberry PI.
Briefly, the objective is to control a stepper motor to take 360 degrees pictures of garbage.
Then it uploades the images to a Django web application.

# Important

Please note that this was one of my first-ever experiences with python. As such, code reflects almost 0 years of experience.
